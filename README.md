# The disclose.io Seal (dioseal)

> Our Vision: A healthy and ubiquitous Internet Immune System  
> Our Mission: To drive vulnerability disclosure adoption through safety, simplicity, and standardization.  

[disclose.io](https://disclose.io) is a collaborative and vendor-agnostic movement that engages security researchers, corporate and independent legal experts, and industry leaders from all around the world. 

The disclose.io Project exists to drive the accelerated adoption of vulnerability disclosure best practices including **bi-lateral safe harbor, readability for non-legal and non-native language audiences, and a recognizable mark of solidarity with the disclose.io movement.**  

# The components
- [The Terms](https://github.com/disclose/dioterms) - A collection of boilerplate vulnerability disclosure policy templates for various geographic juridictions and industry verticals, including high-level generic and simplified term boilerplates.
- [The List](https://github.com/disclose/diodb) - A community-powered list of every known VDP and public bug bounty program, along with its safe harbor status.
- [The Seal](https://github.com/disclose/dioseal) - A recognizable mark to indicate safety for hackers and adoption of best practice to customers.
- [Tools and Data](https://github.com/disclose/diodata) - Useful data and tools for researchers, program owners, and legal teams.
